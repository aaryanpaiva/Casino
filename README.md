# Casino Slot Machine Game

Welcome to the Casino Slot Machine Game solution implemented in Java. This program tackles an intriguing challenge: how to maximize your casino experience by reaching your desired budget with the fewest slot machine plays while adhering to certain rules. Let's dive into the problem description and how this Java solution works.

## Problem Description

Imagine you're at a casino, and you have an initial budget, denoted as Bi. Your goal is to increase your budget to a specific target amount, Bf, by playing various slot machines. Each slot machine has its own cost, Ci, and the prize you can potentially win, Ri. Your mission is to find the most efficient way to reach your target budget while ensuring that your budget never drops below zero.

The challenge involves finding the minimum number of slot machine games required to reach your target budget, Bf. However, there's a catch â€“ you can only play a slot machine if its cost, Ci, does not exceed your current budget. So, you'll need to carefully strategize which machines to play and when to play them.

## Input Format

The input file follows a specific format:
- The first line contains an integer, T, representing the number of test cases to solve.
- For each test case, you'll find:
  - The first line with integers N, Bf, and Bi, indicating the number of available slot machines, the final budget you want to achieve, and your initial budget, respectively.
  - The subsequent N lines provide information about each slot machine, including its cost, Ci, and the potential prize, Ri.

## Output Format

The output file consists of T lines, one for each test case. Each line follows the format:

Here, t represents the test case number, ranging from 1 to T, and R is the minimum number of slot machine games needed to reach the target budget, Bf.

## Usage

To use this Java solution, follow these simple steps:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/your-username/casino-slot-machine-game.git
